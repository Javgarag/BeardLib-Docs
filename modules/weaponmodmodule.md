And any other tweakdata value. There are more that are not listed here yet.

#### The icon

The icon will be stored in guis/dlcs/mods/textures/pd2/blackmarket/icons/mods and will be named `id`.texture then add it using [AddFiles](https://github.com/simon-wh/PAYDAY-2-BeardLib/wiki/AddFiles).

### Example

This example is what you would put inside your main node within your [mod config](https://github.com/GreatBigBushyBeard/PAYDAY-2-BeardLib/wiki/Module-Config)

```markup
<WeaponMod id="wpn_part_YOUR_PART_NAME" based_on="wpn_fps_saw_m_blade_sharp" type="magazine" ver="2">
    <weapons>
        <value_node value="wpn_fps_saw"/>
        <value_node value="wpn_fps_saw_secondary"/>
    </weapons>
</WeaponMod>
```

This will add another saw blade to the saw. Based on an existing saw blade. You will still need to localize the title of the part. In this case `bm_wp_wpn_part_YOUR_PART_NAME` will need to be localized using [LocalizationModule](https://github.com/GreatBigBushyBeard/PAYDAY-2-BeardLib/wiki/LocalizationModule). And add unit, object, material\_config, textures and icon through [AddFiles](https://github.com/simon-wh/PAYDAY-2-BeardLib/wiki/AddFiles) Thankfully shortcuts make it easier:

```markup
<AddFiles directory="assets">
    <texture path="guis/dlcs/mods/textures/pd2/blackmarket/icons/mods/wpn_part_YOUR_PART_NAME"/>    
    <unit_cc path="units/mods/weapons/wpn_part_YOUR_PART_NAME/wpn_part_YOUR_PART_NAME"/>
</AddFiles>
```
